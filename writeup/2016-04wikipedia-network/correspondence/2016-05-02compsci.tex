To the Editors,

We are very pleased to submit our manuscript for consideration at the Journal of Computational Science:\\
\textbf{``Connecting every bit of knowledge:
The structure of Wikipedia\textquotesingle s First Link Network''.}

Our major contributions and findings are as follows:

\textbf{1.}
We connect all 4.7 million Wikipedia articles in a directed network via the first link.
The network reflects how the many inventions, places, figures, objects, and events are related and organized.

\textbf{2.}
We develop a novel algorithm to map the structure of a directed network as a flow. Our measures quantify: \\
\mbox{}\ \textbf{a.}
where references accumulate\\
\mbox{}\ \textbf{b.}
groups of path-connected nodes\\
\mbox{}\ \textbf{c.}
the influence each node exerts in shaping the network.

\textbf{3.}
We identify a gravitation of references on Wikipedia from  specific to general, which culminates disproportionately around only a few fundamental notions. 


Our findings form the basis for a new network-based topic search engine with applications in natural language processing and cognitive psychology.

We look forward to hearing your decision.

Yours sincerely and on behalf of the manuscript's authors,
